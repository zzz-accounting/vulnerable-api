## Description

This repository contains an example Python API that is vulnerable to several different web API attacks.

## Installation

We will be using docker images and containers to install all the api. 
1
### MacOSX

* Download the latest version of [docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)
* Go through installation steps
* Start up Kitematic ![kitematic](kitematic.png).
* In the search box type `mkam/vulnerable-api-demo` and click create ![create](create.png).
* On right side you will see an IP:PORT access url ![ip](ip.png).
* Copy it and paste into browser to navigate to the api ![browser](browser.png).
* Jump to [Install Burp Proxy](#install-burp-proxy)

### Windows

***YOU WILL NEED ADMIN RIGHTS TO INSTALL***

* Download the latest version of [docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)
* Go through installation steps
* Start up Kitematic ![kitematic](kitematic_win.png).
* In the search box type `mkam/vulnerable-api-demo` and click create ![create](create.png).
* On right side you will see an IP:PORT access url ![ip](ip.png).
* Copy it and paste into browser to navigate to the api ![browser](browser.png).
* Jump to [Install Burp Proxy](#install-burp-proxy)

### Linux

* Install docker engine and docker client [on docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/)
* Run `docker run -tid -p 8081:8081 --name api mkam/vulnerable-api-demo`
* You can now test your api `curl localhost:8081 -v`

#### Install Burp Proxy

* Install java [from oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) if you don't have it already
* Download jar file from [burp website](https://portswigger.net/burp/downloadfree.html)
* Run java -jar burpsuite_free_v1.6.32.jar


## API Details

The example API can be accessed on the system at port 8081.

### What is vAPI

vAPI is an API written specifically to illustrate common API vulnerabilities.

vAPI is implemented using the Bottle Python Framework and consists of a user database and a token database.

### How is vAPI Used

#### vAPI Process flow

1. Request token from /tokens
  * Returns an auth token
  * Returns expiration date of auth token
  * Returns a user id
2. Request user record from /user/<user_id>
  * Requires the auth token
  * Returns the user record for the user specfied, provided the auth token is not expired and is valid for the user id specified
  * Each user can only access their own record

#### Test Users 

Included with install

| Username | Password |
|----------|----------|
|user{1-9} |pass{1-9} |
|admin1    |pass1     |

##### POST /user
Creates an user with the given username and password.
2 Conditions:
  1. User cannot already exist
  2. Username has to meet strict naming guidlines. The username must be matched by this regular expression: ```([a-z]+)*[0-9]```. This means that a username has to start with a lowercase letter and end with numbers. So, usernames that look like "user1" or "abc123" will be accepted, but usernames that look like "USER1" or "1user" will not be accepted.

###### Request Headers
1. X-Auth-Token - Valid token for the admin user

###### Request JSON Object
1. User 
  * name (string) – Username that matches above conditions
  * password (string) – Password

###### Response JSON Object
1. response
  * user
    - username - the name of the succesfully created user
    - password - the password of the successfully created user
